# Introduction 

Interactions between aerosol and clouds yield one of the largest sources of uncertainty in understanding climate and future climate change on regional and global scales [@Boucher2013]. Within the Earth's atmosphere, homogeneous liquid water droplet formation is not thermodynamically favorable [@Pruppacher1997]; instead, the pathway to nucleating cloud droplets is aided by the presence of ambient aerosol, a subset of which possess physical and chemical characteristics which allow them to serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). These CCN provide a linkage between the physiochemical processes of atmospheric particles and cloud microphysics.

Changes in the background aerosol population can directly affect the properties of a nascent cloud droplet population. For instance, holding liquid water content constant, an increase in the number of CCN would tend to increase the total cloud droplet number concentration (the "Twomey" effect)  while necessarily reducing the average size of the droplets [@Twomey1974]. Such a change could enhance a cloud's albedo, an effect which could be further amplified through microphysical feedbacks since smaller droplets impede the production of drizzle and thus lengthen cloud lifetime [@Albrecht1989]. Mechanisms whereby aerosol influence the properties of clouds (and ultimately climate) are generally known as "aerosol indirect effects" [@Haywood2000; @Lohmann2005] and provide a path for changes in the ambient aerosol to produce cascading effects up to progressively larger scales of atmospheric motion [e.g. @Wang2005; @Ekman2011; @Morrison2011; @Tao2011; @Fan2012; @Altaratz2014].

Aerosol indirect effects can either warm or cool the climate, but they all fundamentally depend on a subset of the ambient aerosols which function as CCN. The theory describing the dependency of cloud droplet nucleation (also known as aerosol activation) on CCN availability and ambient aerosol has been rigorously developed using adiabatic and entraining parcel theory [@Seinfeld2006; @Pruppacher1997], and depends on details of the heterogeneous chemical composition, number, size distribution(s) and mixing state of the background aerosol [@Mcfiggans2006] as well as local meteorology [@Morales2010]. Under polluted conditions, effects relating to chemical composition could produce a climatic effect as large as the basic "Twomey" effect [@Nenes2002a; @Lance2004]. 

The development of activation parameterizations was pioneered by @Twomey1959 and @Squires1961, who derived a relationship between the number of activated particles and the environmental supersaturation based on an aerosol size distribution approximated by a power law. @Ghan2011 presented a thorough overview of subsequent developments over the past five decades and an inter-comparison of several modern parameterizations. However, there is still an active effort to improve these parameterizations, as they are increasingly called upon to mediate between ever more complex aerosol models and the climate models to which they are coupled. For instance, the parameterization initially developed by @Nenes2003 has seen continuous development, including modifications to handle condensation onto insoluble but wettable particles using adsorption-activation theory [@Kumar2009], environmental entrainment [@Barahona2007], and numerical improvement of the population-splitting technique [@Barahona2010; @MoralesBetancourt2014b]. Similarly, @Ghan2011 extended the parameterization of @Abdul-Razzak2000 to account for non-unity values of the accommodation coefficient $a_c$. Beyond idealized testing and droplet closure studies [@Meskhidze2005; @Fountoukis2007], these modern parameterizations have been implemented in coupled climate-aerosol models such as the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to predict online cloud droplet number concentrations, where they have been shown to correct biases in global average cloud droplet number concentrations and improve agreement with cloud properties measured from satellite-born instruments [@Gantt2014]. Furthermore, adjoints of these parameterizations have been derived and coupled to chemical transport and global models in order to study the sensitivities of cloud droplet number to aerosol, chemical and microphysical factors [@Karydis2012; @Moore2013].

Additionally, following the original integral/geometric approach by @Twomey1959, analytical representations of supersaturation evolution from adiabatic parcel theory have been progressively generalized to relate aerosol distributions to activation kinetics [@Cohard1998; @Khvorostyanov2006; @Khvorostyanov2008; @Shipway2010; @Shipway2015]. Although fundamentally analytical parameterizations, schemes of this class typically rely on expensive numerical operations, such as in the evaluation of hypergeometric functions and iterative loops.

While most of these recent efforts towards improving activation parameterizations have focused on building highly generalized, "physically-based" tools, there is still an application for other parameterization approaches. @Saleeby2004 parameterized droplet nucleation for a cloud-resolving model, the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS), by constructing a four-dimensional lookup table based on temperature, vertical velocity, aerosol number concentration, and the median radius of a lognormal aerosol mode with assumed chemical composition. A fifth dimension representing chemical composition via aerosol hygroscopicity (following $\kappa$-KÃ¶hler theory [@Petters2007]) was added to the lookup table [@Ward2010] and later generalized to aerosol soluble fraction [@Saleeby2013]. Constructing lookup tables of detailed parcel model results can be considered a form of model emulation combining a cache of known results and local polynomial (linear) approximation. 

As the degrees of freedom and number of parameters describing a given aerosol population in a model increase, the burden of saving enough known points to interpolate through the parameter space via lookup table to some reasonable accuracy increases algebraically. For instance, the CESM features a modal aerosol population with three predefined, internally mixed lognormal modes, each with a fixed geometric standard deviation [@Liu2012]. Each mode is uniquely described by two moments (total number and total mass concentration) and the chemical composition of the mode by a single prognostic hygroscopicity term. Thus, the entire aerosol population has $N=9$ degrees of freedom - too many to build a lookup table of activation statistics. Physically-based parameterizations were designed to accommodate these sorts of arbitrary mixtures of aerosol, but have a tendency to systematically underestimate activated fractions and subsequently cloud droplet number [@Simpson2014]. This is due to the parameterizations' use of a set of assumptions which become increasingly likely to be violated as the aerosol population becomes more complex, specifically (1) that proto-droplets grow in equilibrium with environmental changes in relative humidity, and (2) that there are no kinetic or inertial limitations to droplet growth. The presence of giant CCN [@Barahona2010] and weak updrafts or excessively polluted conditions [@Nenes2001] exacerbates this problem. 

The goal of this study is to apply a surrogate modeling or emulation technique commonly used in the uncertainty quantification literature to a detailed parcel model capable of describing aerosol activation; this yields an efficient parameterization optimized for the high-dimensional parameter space effecting droplet nucleation in coupled aerosol-climate model. In essence, employing the derived emulator as an activation parameterization would be akin to directly coupling a detailed parcel model to a global model. Such a parameterization would be directly physically-based, but rely on fewer assumptions which affect the condensational growth of aerosol into CCN. However, it would also incorporate the efficiency of a lookup table, since the emulator would be designed to require a scarce amount of cached information and to be computationally cheap to evaluate. Additionally, it would improve upon the framework of lookup table and be extensible to a very high-dimensional parameter space and thus be compatible with aerosol-climate models of increasing complexity. 

Section \ref{sec:methodology} describes the parcel model and the probabilistic collocation method (PCM) used to build its emulator. Section \ref{sec:results} presents results from applying the PCM to build a parcel model emulator designed to simulate the activation of a single lognormal aerosol mode under a wide variety of background environments and compares the new emulator to existing activation parameterizations. Section \ref{sec:conclusion} motivates an extension of the technique to an emulator suitable of mediating aerosol activation in a coupled aerosol-climate model.
